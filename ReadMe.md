## Learning Python Basics
I used the book [Pythonの絵本] as the reference.
The primary goal is to 
* Setup development environment for Python
* Have confidence in coding Python at high-level
* Have image ①what is basic, ②what is next step to actually use

### Major learning themes
#### Milestones
1. Basic--HelloWorld and Variables
2. Using list and turple
3. Using conditions
4. Operating on files
5. Basic object thinking with Python

### Sub-Themes
I used PyCharm as the IDE for practicing (programming) Python.

Python is interpretor (conversational) language.
Like linux terminal, type the code and it operates.
For the learning convention, I've downloaded PyCharm, to program as if they are procedural langauge.

I can type in files and compile all together.
